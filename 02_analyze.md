# 02_analyze

In this exercise, we will run interactive analysis of the data we brought in through a data pipeline into the Cloudera's Data Warehouse - Impala.

## Pre-requisite

1. Please ensure that you have completed the [lab](01_ingest.md#lab-2-ingest-into-other-tables-needed-for-analysis-and-visualization) to ingest data needed for Analysis.

## Lab 1: Explore the data ingested

1. We will continue to analyze the data in Hue.
2. On the left pane, you will see a catalog of all the `databases` available. Click on "airlines"
3. On the left pane, you will now see a list of all the `tables` ingested through your ETL/ELT pipeline in the 01_ingest phase
4. You can now click on the table name to explore the schema of the table and run any sample queries to explore the dataset

## Lab 2: Build Business Intelligence Reports

We will now run interactive queries to build business intelligence reports. The business wants to build Passenger Manifest & Layover Reporting dashboard to get actionable insights out of the data.

You can run the below queries on the interactive query editor.

1. Click on Editor - Impala to go to your interactive editor

**Query 1:**  Query to find all international flights: flights where destination airport country is not the same as origin airport country

```
SELECT DISTINCT
    flightnum,
    uniquecarrier,
    origin,
    dest,
    `month`,
    dayofmonth,
    `dayofweek`
FROM
    `airlines`.flights f,
    `airlines`.airports oa,
    `airlines`.airports da
WHERE
    f.origin = oa.iata
    and f.dest = da.iata
    and oa.country <> da.country
ORDER BY
    `month` ASC,
    dayofmonth ASC;
```

**Query 2:** Query to explore passenger manifest data:Â  do we have international connecting flights?

```
SELECT
*
FROM
   `airlines`.unique_tickets a,
   `airlines`.flights o,
   `airlines`.flights d,
   `airlines`.airports oa,
   `airlines`.airports da 
WHERE
   a.leg1flightnum = o.flightnum
   AND a.leg1uniquecarrier = o.uniquecarrier
   AND a.leg1origin = o.origin
   AND a.leg1dest = o.dest
   AND a.leg1month = o.month
   AND a.leg1dayofmonth = o.dayofmonth
   AND a.leg1dayofweek = o.`dayofweek`
   AND a.leg2flightnum = d.flightnum
   AND a.leg2month = d.month
   AND a.leg2dayofmonth = d.dayofmonth
   AND a.leg2dayofweek = d.`dayofweek`
   AND d.origin = oa.iata
   AND d.dest = da.iata;
```

**Query 3:** Number of passengers on the airline that has long, planned layovers for an international flight

```
SELECT
    a.leg1uniquecarrier as carrier,
    count(a.leg1uniquecarrier) as passengers
FROM
    `airlines`.unique_tickets a
where
    a.leg2deptime - a.leg1arrtime>90
group by
    a.leg1uniquecarrier;
```

**Query 4:** Number of passengers on airlines that have elongated layovers for an international flight caused by delayed connection
```
SELECT
   a.leg1uniquecarrier as carrier,
   count(a.leg1uniquecarrier) as passengers
FROM
   `airlines`.unique_tickets a,
   `airlines`.flights o,
   `airlines`.flights d
where
       a.leg1flightnum = o.flightnum
   AND a.leg1uniquecarrier = o.uniquecarrier
   AND a.leg1origin = o.origin
   AND a.leg1dest = o.dest
   AND a.leg1month = o.month
   AND a.leg1dayofmonth = o.dayofmonth
   AND a.leg1dayofweek = o.`dayofweek`
   AND a.leg2uniquecarrier = d.uniquecarrier
   AND a.leg2origin = d.origin
   AND a.leg2dest = d.dest
   AND a.leg2month = d.month
   AND a.leg2dayofmonth = d.dayofmonth
   AND a.leg2dayofweek = d.`dayofweek`
group by
   a.leg1uniquecarrier;
```
